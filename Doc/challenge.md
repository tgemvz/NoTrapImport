- How to handle multiple products on website
- Some technical details are only available in images

## Abstract

## Process

- EAN API not free. We extract data ourselves. We could cache the decision by EAN.

### Data Extraction

#### Limitations
- structured output. Currently via "system message".

### Querying/Prompting

### Vectorization

- DB initialization, if no fitting file is present

#### Limitations
- No duplicate check on db initialization

## Technical Challenges
- Apertus
    - No structured output
    - No dotnet wrapper (OpenAI Client didn't work)
- RAG
    - Chunking: Can't feed whole documents to LLM

## Future Work

In the short timeframe, not every idea and process was realistic to be realised. In this section, we want to show some further work that could be done, to improve on the existing solution prototype.

### Classification Enrichment
- Extracted product data can be enriched with web searches to optimally define the product in question

### Full Scan
Currently the check will be accomplished by extracting text data. Further improvements could be achieved by also evaluating visual data like images or video.
This could be incorporated by providing a "Full Scan" option to the user, which will take longer, but will consider more data thus being more precise.
